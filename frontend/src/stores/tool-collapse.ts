 * Which of the tools page's groups are folded shut.

 * One panel per server was the right answer to "what does this server
 * offer" (it replaced a flat list where the server was a word on a card),
 * but it left nothing to do about five servers of forty tools each except
 * scroll past the ones that are not the question. The list layout made
 * each group shorter; it did not offer the step before reading, which is
 * putting away what you are not reading.
 *
 * Kept in the browser rather than in the gateway's configuration, for the
 * same reason as the theme and the layout: it belongs to whoever is
 * looking at the screen, not to the installation.
