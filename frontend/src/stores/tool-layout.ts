 * How the tools page lays its tools out.
 *
 * Cards read well when there are a dozen of them and the descriptions are
 * worth reading. They stop working when a server offers forty: the page
 * becomes a wall to scroll, and the question turns from "what does this do"
 * into "where is the one I want". A row per tool answers that one, so both
 * exist and the choice is the reader's.
 *
 * Kept in the browser rather than in the gateway's configuration, for the
 * same reason as the theme: it belongs to whoever is looking at the screen,
 * not to the installation. Two people sharing one gateway should not be
 * overwriting each other's preference.
