# Seed the data directory on a first start, then get out of the way.

# Why this exists at all: the gateway's own default allows loopback only,
# which is right for a program on someone's machine and wrong inside a
# container. Traffic published to the host does not arrive from loopback —
# it arrives from the container network's gateway address — so a container
# left on that default answers 403 to everything, the web interface
# included. That is not a rejection a user should have to decode from a log.
#
# So the seeded configuration opens the allowlist to every client; the
# reasoning is written into the file itself. It writes only on a first
# start — after that the file belongs to whoever edits it, through the web
# interface, the CLI or by hand, and this leaves it alone.

    # defaults to, and a later upgrade that changes a default is free to.

security:
  # Empty list means "accept every client" — as opposed to leaving the key
  # out, which asks for the loopback-only default, and that would reject
  # everything reaching this container through its published port.
  #
  # For a container the access boundary is the published port and whatever
  # sits in front of it, not this list. To restrict by source address
  # instead, replace [] with the CIDR blocks allowed to reach the
  # management API, e.g. [10.0.0.0/8].
