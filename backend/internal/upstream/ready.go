// themselves, open a port, or load a model first, and only then print a
// line saying so. Handing such a server a handshake immediately means the
// handshake's timeout is really a startup timeout, and a server that
// takes a minute to install looks broken rather than slow.
//
// So the process is started, its standard error is read until one of the
// configured patterns matches, and only then does the handshake begin.
