// The configuration reference was the one part of this project's account of
// itself that nothing was checking.
//
// internal/guide has four tests holding its document against the program —
// the commands it names, the flags it names, the system tools it explains,
// the constants it quotes — and they caught real drift three times during
// development. docs/configuration.md had none of that, and by the time
// these tests were written it was wrong in two ways at once: four fields
// added later were missing from it, and one field's description said the
// opposite of what the code does.
//
// So these check the document against the struct rather than against an
// expected text, for the same reason the guide tests do: an expected text
// only asserts that the file has not been edited, and has to be updated
// every time it is.
//
// What they cannot check is prose. A field name is either in the document
// or it is not; whether the sentence beside it is true is not something
// reflect can see. That boundary is real — the sentence that was wrong
// here needed an assertion of its own.

// The document lives in the repository, beside the other things a reader
// browses, rather than inside this module. A //go:embed directive cannot
// reach outside its own module directory; a test reading a file has no
// such limit.
