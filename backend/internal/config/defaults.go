// DefaultReadyTimeout is how long a server with ready patterns is waited

// A compromise between two costs. Waiting longer helps a server that is
// genuinely slow to start — a package manager fetching one that has never
// run on this machine. Waiting less limits the damage when the pattern is
// wrong, which is the more likely mistake: that wait is paid in full on
// every connection attempt and every retry, before there is any evidence
// the server works at all. Anyone who needs longer can say so, in the
// field right next to the patterns.

// explicit "enabled: false" would be indistinguishable.

// ReadyTimeout is deliberately left at zero rather than seeded here: it
// only means anything alongside ready patterns, and seeding it would
// write a readyTimeout into the file of every server that has none.
