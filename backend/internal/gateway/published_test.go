// paths, and nothing was making them agree.
//
// They drifted. The management view reported only the forwarded tools, so
// the gateway's own seven were invisible in the web interface and in the
// CLI while being served perfectly well over MCP — one number said 16 and
// the other said 23, and no test compared them.

// This is that comparison. It is not a tautology: one side is assembled
// by the management API from the gateway's own bookkeeping, the other is
// whatever the SDK's server decides to answer a real client with.
