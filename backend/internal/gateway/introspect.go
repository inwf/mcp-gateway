// The gateway talks to itself over a pipe for the two things it cannot do
// from the outside: reading back what its own tools look like, and
// calling one of them on behalf of the management API.
//
// Both go through a real MCP session rather than reaching for the Go
// functions behind the tools. That is the point: the SDK does the same
// schema generation, argument decoding, validation and result encoding it
// does for any other client, so a tool called from the web interface
// behaves exactly as it does when a model calls it. Every shortcut past
// the SDK would be a second implementation of one of those steps, and a
// second implementation is a thing that can disagree with the first.

// systemToolReadTimeout bounds the one round trip that reads the
// gateway's own tools back off its server. It talks to itself over a
// pipe, so this only guards against a deadlock.

// internalClientName identifies the gateway to itself in the initialize

// sessionLedger records the two things the gateway knows about its own
// sessions that the SDK does not report, both of which decide whether a
// session is a connected client.
//
// An operator reading that list is asking who is connected. Two kinds of
// session are not an answer to that question:
//
// The gateway talking to itself. It opens in-process sessions to read its
// own tools back and to run a tool for the management API.
//
// A session nobody got past the handshake on. One connecting client can
// create two: the SDK client tries the modern server/discover handshake
// first and, when there is no version overlap, abandons that session and
// starts again with the legacy initialize on a fresh one. The abandoned
// session is never closed — it waits for the session timeout, half an hour
// by default — so during that time one client is reported as two. That was
// the bug: a list of who is connected that doubles every entry is not
// describing the installation.
//
// Sessions are tracked by identity rather than by the client name they
// announce, because a name is something a remote client chooses: filtering
// on one would let any client hide itself from the list by claiming to be
// this one.

// Dropping the mark at that point leaves the session listed and no longer
// known to be internal — the one state that must never be reachable,
