// counted as a collision on one side and not the other, so even an
// exposed tool could be reported under the wrong name.

// and those schemas are not small — one upstream search tool here
// declares fifteen parameters. Spending a model's context on the
// arguments of tools it will never call is the cost this avoids.
//
// It costs nothing in reach. A tool that is not exposed is still
// callable: the gateway's own call_tool reads the unfiltered upstream
// state, as do list_tools, get_tool and search_tools. A model finds what
// it needs through those and calls it by name. "Not exposed" means "not
// in the opening hand", not "unavailable" — one extra round trip in
// exchange for not paying for every tool up front.
//
// An empty list and an absent one mean the same thing, and there is
// deliberately no way to spell "expose everything": a set that grows on
// its own whenever an upstream adds a tool is exactly what this prevents.
