# mcphub, built the way the Makefile builds it.
#
# Three stages, because the two toolchains are only needed to build: the
# frontend is built with Node, the binary with Go, and the image that
# actually runs carries neither. Same ordering the Makefile explains —
# frontend first, its output copied where `embed` can reach it, then the
# binary with the tag that turns embedding on.
#
# The versions are pinned to what the repository asks for: go.mod says
# 1.25, README says Node 22+.

# ===== the web interface =====

# pnpm comes from the lockfile's own packageManager field where there is
# one; this project has none, so the version is pinned here rather than
# left to whatever `corepack` resolves on the day the image is built.

# The manifest, the lockfile and the workspace file first, so that a
# change to application source does not re-run the install.
# --frozen-lockfile is what makes the build reproducible: it fails rather
# than quietly resolving something new.
#
# pnpm-workspace.yaml is not optional here even though this is a single
# project: it carries the `allowBuilds` decision about msw's install
# script. Without it, pnpm stops and asks — which in a build means it
# fails.

# ca-certificates for dialling a streamable-http upstream over TLS;
# tzdata so log timestamps in a configured timezone are right. Neither is
# in a bare alpine.
#
# nodejs and npm are here because the most common stdio upstreams are npx
# packages, and a gateway that cannot spawn the servers people actually
# configure would need a derived image before it was useful. This is the
# one place this image is deliberately larger than it has to be.
RUN apk add --no-cache ca-certificates tzdata nodejs npm

# writes its configuration and logs there, so ownership has to be set

# ownership of the directory it covers.

#
# --host 0.0.0.0 rather than the default loopback, because loopback inside a
# container is reachable from nothing. As a flag rather than a setting in
# the file, so it stays out of what the user edits and applies to this run
# only.
#
# Reaching the management API is still a deliberate act: the compose file
# publishes to 127.0.0.1 on the host, and security.allowedNetworks still
# has to admit the caller.
