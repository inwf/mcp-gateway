# mcphub

# Two toolchains, and three steps that have to happen in order: the
# frontend is built, its output is placed where the Go build can embed
# it, and then the binary is built with the tag that turns embedding on.
# That ordering is the whole reason this file exists — everything else
# here is a plain `go` or `pnpm` command, and can be run as one.

SHELL := /bin/sh

BACKEND  := backend

# Where the frontend's output has to land for the embed directive to
# find it. Generated; not in version control.

BIN := $(BACKEND)/bin/mcphub

# The tag that switches embedding on. A binary built without it works
# and serves the API; it just has no web interface.
